        <h2>To My Dearest & Lovely Wife,</h2>
        <p>
            On your special day, I wish I could be right by your side, holding you close and celebrating together. But even though distance separates us physically, you are always in my heart, closer than ever. This journey of being apart has only made me realize how deeply I cherish you, how much your love means to me, and how strong we are as a couple.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day we spend apart is a day I think about how lucky I am to have you in my life. Our late-night conversations, the messages we exchange, and the small ways we stay connected are a reminder that love knows no boundaries. The distance may be tough, but itâ€™s a testament to the strength of what we share. We've proven that no matter the miles between us, our love is resilient and unbreakable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am constantly amazed by your patience, understanding, and the unwavering faith you have in us. You make everything feel possible, and you give me hope for the future we will build togetherâ€”when distance will no longer be a barrier and every day will be filled with your presence, your laughter, and your love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until then, I carry you in my heart, in every thought, in every moment. I look forward to the day when we no longer have to count the days until we see each other, when goodbyes become unnecessary, and all our dreams come true. I love you more than words can express, and I am so grateful for every moment we've sharedâ€”whether near or far.
        </p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, my love! Here's to many more moments of joy together!</p>
